Sound
======
Since music is about rhythmic sound, lets understand what is sound and how we perceive sound. 

### Basics of sound
Sound of a musical instrument is called tone. Sound is created by variations in air pressure. Variations in air pressure is caused by air vibration. Musical instruments are unique in their way of producing structurally distinctive air vibrations. Music performer regulates these vibrations (such as timing of vibration, number of vibrations per second, duration of vibration). Scientific study of sound perception is known as Psychoacoustics.

#### Frequency
Number of vibrations per second is known as frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). We normally hear sounds in the frequency range between 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz. Frequency is a physical property of a sound.

#### Pitch
In the context of hearing sensations, our perceptual interpretation of frequency of a sound is known as pitch. In a music keyboard, each key represents a unique pitch.

#### Pressure level
Variations in air pressure is measured in Pascal. Our ear can detect variations in air pressure ranging between 10 ÂµPa and 100 Pa. Pressure level is a physical property of a sound.

#### Loudness
In the context of hearing sensations, our perceptual interpretation of pressure level of a sound is known as loudness.
