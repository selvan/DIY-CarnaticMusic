Sound
======
Since music is about rhythmic sound, lets understand what is sound and how we perceive sound, in scientific way. 

### Basics of sound
Sound of a musical intrument is caled tone. Sound is created by variations in air pressure. Variations in air pressure is caused by air vibration. Musical instruments are unique in their way of producing structurally distinctive air vibrations. Music performer regulates these vibrations (such as timing of vibration, number of vibrations per second, duration of vibration, volume)

Number of vibrations per second is called frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz. Frquency of a sound is called pitch. In a music keyboard, each key represents a unique pitch.
