Sound
======
Since music is about rhythmic sound, lets understand what is sound and how we perceive sound, in scientific way. 

### Basic of sound
Sound is created by variations in air pressure. Variations in air pressure is caused by air vibration. Musical instruments are unique in their own way of creating patterns of these air vibration. Music performer regulates these vibrations (such as number of vibrations per second, duration of vibration, volume)

Number of vibrations per second is called frequency. Frequency is measured in hertz. Frquency of a sound is called pitch. In a music keyboard, each key represents a unique pitch.
