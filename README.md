DIY - Hackers guide to understanding carnatic music
=====================================================

This DIY guide is based on my hacking philosophy,

-	Understanding basics through experimentation, introspection & breaking rules.
-	Measuring and quantification of basics.
-	Finding ways to regulate them, inorder to use it in your own way.

If you consider carnatic music learning must be sacred and revered, you are in wrong place.
