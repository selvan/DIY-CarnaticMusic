DIY - Hackers guide to understanding carnatic music
=====================================================

#### Introduction
Like many of us, I enjoy film music composed by Ilayaraja and A.R. Rahman. Other day, I was walking along street & saw flute vendor playing a movie song. My mind able to co-relate music played by the flute vendor to the song composed by Ilayaraja. How am I able to co-relate both?, because both are in same rhythm. Rhythm is what we perceive when we listen to music. Rhythm is subjective. Based on our mood/taste/culture we prefer certain rhythms over other.

In one way, rhythm is like physical attractiveness of human beings. When we approach physician for a non-cosmetic treatment, he doesn't deal with our attractiveness, but deals with more fundamental level (such as body temperature, blood pressure, heartbeat, anatomy etc). Carnatic music is a form of understanding rhythms at fundamental level. Once we understand the fundamental, we will able to measure, quantify, classify various rhythms. Even, we would able to create new rhythm based on our personal taste.

This DIY guide is based on my hacking philosophy,

-	Understanding basics through experimentation, introspection & breaking rules.
-	Measuring and quantification of basics.
-	Finding ways to regulate them, inorder to use it in your own way.

If you consider carnatic music learning must be sacred and revered, you are in wrong place.
